The error message indicates that the \u0060this\u0060 pointer is null, which means that the object being accessed is not initialized or has been deleted. \r\n\r\nThis might be happening because the \u0060SceneManager\u0060 object is being destroyed before the \u0060Engine\u0060 object. The \u0060SceneManager\u0060 object is responsible for managing the scenes in the game and is being deleted in the \u0060Engine::Destroy()\u0060 method. However, the \u0060SceneManager\u0060 object is a member of the \u0060Engine\u0060 object, so it should be deleted after the \u0060Engine\u0060 object is destroyed. \r\n\r\nTo fix this error, you can change the order in which the objects are destroyed. First, destroy the \u0060Engine\u0060 object, then destroy the \u0060SceneManager\u0060 object.
